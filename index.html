    <p>I have been working as a freelance editor and translator of web novels since 2016.
        It started as a hobby that turned into a great way to improve my language skills as a bilingual
        of English and Chinese while earning some ü•ú money.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I learn languages, mainly Japanese, Korean, and Pythonüêç, a computer programming language.</p>
